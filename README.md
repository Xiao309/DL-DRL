# DL-DRL
Code for TASE Paper: DL-DRL: A Double-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Large-Scale Task Scheduling of Multi-UAV
It contains the implementation codes for fleet with 4 and 6 UAVs

This code is adapted from the repository [attention-learn-to-route](https://github.com/wouterkool/attention-learn-to-route)

## Quick Start

### UAV4
Train the model, run `./UAV4/fleet_v4/run.py`

Test the model, run `./UAV4/fleet_v4/eval.py`

### UAV6
Train the model, run `./UAV6/fleet_v6/run.py`

Test the model, run `./UAV6/fleet_v6/eval.py`
